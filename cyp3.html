										<h3>Offensive and Defensive Analysis of Lockheed Martin Kill Chain</h3>
										<!--<p>Just an incredibly simple responsive site<br />
										template freebie by <a href="http://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a>.</p>-->

										<h3>About the Project</h3>
									</header>
									<p align="justify">In this project, a vulnerable application was deployed on Amazon Web Services and the seven steps of the Lockheed Martin Kill Chain were executed, both from the attacker's and defender's perspectives. A threat model of the deployed application was created using the STRIDE method. Finally, an analysis of the results was drawn and countermeasures were proposed to secure the application. The final results also validated the accuracy of the threat model, and tabulated if the vulnerabilities exploited in the Offense stage were reported or not.</p>
									<header>
										<h3>Solution and Approach</h3>
									</header>
									<p align="justify"><u>Vulnerable Application Deployment:</u> A web application vulnerable to Brute Force, SQL Injection and Command Injection was deployed on the AWS Cloud.<br> <u>Thrat Analysis:</u> A complete Threat Analysis on the Web Architecture was conduced using the Microsoft Threat Modelling Tool, mapping threats into the STRIDE Framework.
									<ul>
									<li> <u>User View:</u> The deployed application was analyzed from the user view, and a Threat Model was developed assuming a threat originating from outside the environment.</li>
									<li> <u>Administration View:</u> The deployed application was analyzed from the administration view, and a Threat Model was developed assuming a threat originating from within the production environment.</li>
									<li> <u>Custom Threat Modelling Template:</u> The Microsoft Threat Modelling Tool does not contain a stencil for Amazon Web Services resources. Therefore, a new stencil was created to include AWS resources. This involved adding the resources, mapping the threats associated with each resource (S3, EC2), and categorizing the threats into the existing STRIDE Framework. The resulting stencil was then merged with the existing stencil to create a comprehensive Threat Model to accurately map the threats associated with the deployed architecture.</li>
									</ul>
									<u>Offensive Analysis:</u> An attack was consucted on the deployed Web Application, following the steps of the Lockheed Martin Kill Chain. This analysis provided an opportunity to map an attacker's TTPs with the Cyber Kill Chain.<br><u>Defensive Analysis:</u> A step-by-step Defensive Analysis was conducted to propose security recommendations to prevent exploitation at each stage fo the Kill Chain. </p>

										<h3>Impact</h3>
									</header>
									<p align="justify">This project helped me get hands-on experience in conducting a comprhensive Threat Modelling exercise. I was also able to research the Microsoft Threat Modelling Tool, and a deep-dive into the threat landscape associated with the AWS resources from the viewpoint of the STRIDE Framework.</p>
